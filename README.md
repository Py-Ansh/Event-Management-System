# Event Manager

## Inspiration

Hello, World!  
I present to you the Event Manager.

This project aims to help people in local neighborhoods and communities host, find, and join events more conveniently. Inspired by the vibrant culture of my locality in India, where festivals and events are a significant part of life, this project seeks to streamline the registration and fee collection process traditionally done door-to-door by event organizers.

## What It Does

Our Event Manager allows members of a community to:
- Register on the website
- Find local events
- Host their own events
- Join other events effortlessly

This simplifies the process of organizing and participating in community events, making it more efficient and accessible.

## How We Built It

This project is a web application developed using:
- Python's Django framework
- HTML
- CSS


## What's Next for Event Manager

To make this application even more helpful, I have several future features in mind:
1. Q&A section for each event to facilitate better communication among participants.
2. Automated reminders and notifications for upcoming events.
3. A feedback system to improve future events based on participant suggestions.


By implementing these features, I aim to make the Event Manager a comprehensive tool for community event management.
